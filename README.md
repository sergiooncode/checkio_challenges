# Check iO Challenges

[Check iO](http://www.checkio.org/) is the game for coders.

For experienced developers CheckiO is a fun competition and a way to share their knowledge. For novice coders it is a self tutoring community where code review and feedback are game elements. For IT companies itâ€™s a tool to find and prescreen coders or crowd source software on a challenge basis. 

I use the challenges as katas to practice coding in Python. 

The challenges solved so far are: 

- <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/most-wanted-letter/" target="_blank">The Most Wanted Letter</a>
- <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/house-password/" target="_blank">House Password</a>
- <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/median/" target="_blank">Median</a>
